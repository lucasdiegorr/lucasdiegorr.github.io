Python is widely known by your capacity to make mathematical operations fast. Allied  your writing power, Python is a powerful tool by scientists to make complex calculus and others data processings.

This article is to show some characteristics of numbers in Python:
- [The Primitive Types](#primitives);
- [The Operators in Python](#operators);
- [Conversion of Numbers](#conversion);
- [Mathematics Functions](#mathematics-functions);
- [Random Number Functions](#random-functions);
- [Trigonometric Functions](#trigonometrics-functions);
- [Mathematical Constants](#mathematics-constants);

## <a id="primitives"></a> The Primitive Types
Python has supports four numerical types: *int*, *long*, *float* and *complex*.

Each one of kind this represents a set in Set Theory.

- ***Int***: represents the set ***Z*** in Set Theory, in others words represents all **integers** numbers, positives or negatives, like -1, 1000 and more a infinite. :D
